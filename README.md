# Double Pendulum Simulator

This double pendulum simulator simulates and then animates the motion and trace of a double pendulum using the Runge-Kutta 4th-order integration method for 2nd-order ODEs (ordinary differential equations).
The double pendulum is a common chaotic system in classical mechanics.
Animation is rendered using SDL2.
